# Docker Compose Routing

## Description

This code is useful when you need to route requests from different Docker containers to different host network interfaces.

## Usage

Start Docker Compose (now it starts with a simple Express.js server inside, you would probably want to replace it), and then check `routing.sh` and add routes and iptables rules according to your network configuration.
Also, I've added Ansible playbook for Ubuntu 22.04, you can use it. It should be easy to adapt it to any other distro I think â€” and I'll appreciate any PRs.
